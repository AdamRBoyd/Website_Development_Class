# Instructions: Practice (0 pts)

You are building an ugly web page for your web site development class. You are given the following files:

* An `index.html` file. **This cannot be modified.**
* A `practice.css` CSS file. You will be adding your styling to this file.
* A `practice.js` JavaScript file. You will be adding your code to this file

Prior to your work the HTML page will look like:

![prior to work](prior.png)

Afterwards it will look like this:

![ugly page part 1](result1.png)

and this:

![ugly page part 2](result2.png)

## (a) Update NetId with JavaScript (0 pts)

Using JavaScript in the `practice.js` file insert your NetId information in to the `<span>` in the last `<h2>` element in the `<header>`.

## (b) Set some colors(0 pts)

Set overall background color to *lavender*, set main background color to "blanchedalmond". Set other colors on the elements and the text to approximately match my ugly mess.

Set the CSS so as to limit the content to no wider than 40 "normal" characters.

## (d) Set some borders (0 pts)

Approximately match my borders.
