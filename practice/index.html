            <h1>What About JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is very <strong>important</strong> and will be on the exam. Make sure your local repo and corresponding GitHub repo are all on the same branch and ready to <strong>go</strong>!</p>
            <p>This is a <strong>time limited</strong> exam, hence you don't want to waste any time on <em>git</em> or <em>GitHub</em>.</p>

            <h1>What About HTML</h1>
            <p>HTML is at the heart of everything we do. So you can't forget your HTML. On the exam you may spend more time reading my HTML5 rather than writing much yourself.</p>
            <p>Remember to commit and push as often as you like. You should not need a very fast Internet connection for the exam. There is <strong>no</strong> video or audio in the exam. You will want key reference pages on JavaScript and the DOM to be
                easily and quickly available.</p>
            <p>Commits after the two hour time limit will <strong>not</strong> be considered. Push and commit often. Your code <strong>must</strong> work to receive credit.</p>
