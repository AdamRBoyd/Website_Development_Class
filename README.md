## Question 2

### (a) 

*Should we put this inside or outside the ```<main>``` element according to the specification?*

* The header should be outside the main element and scoped by body, it is introductory content for main.

### (b)

*Is it okay to put the ```<footer>``` in ```<main>```?*

* The footer should be placed outside and after the main (within the body), but there are cases where it is ok to place it within.

*What about as the last item in the ```<body>```?*

* Yes, it should be the last item in the body as it is typically at the bottom of the page.

*Would you prefer one over the other? Why?*

* I prefer placing the footer after the main, as it is typically a place for things like copyright that need not be in the middle of the page.
